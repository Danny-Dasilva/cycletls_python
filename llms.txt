# CycleTLS Python

> Python HTTP client that impersonates real browsers - bypass anti-bot detection with TLS/JA3/JA4/HTTP2 fingerprinting. Unlike requests or httpx, CycleTLS makes your requests indistinguishable from real browser traffic.

CycleTLS is a high-performance Python HTTP client built on a Go backend, providing advanced TLS fingerprinting capabilities. Use it for web scraping, API access, and bypassing bot detection systems that rely on TLS fingerprinting (Cloudflare, Akamai, etc.).

Key capabilities:
- TLS fingerprint spoofing (JA3, JA4R, HTTP/2 Akamai fingerprints)
- Browser impersonation (Chrome, Firefox, Safari profiles)
- Modern protocols (HTTP/2, HTTP/3/QUIC, WebSocket, SSE)
- requests-like API with full async/await support
- Session management with persistent cookies
